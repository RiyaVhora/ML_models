Comparing different 4 machine learning models(Decision Tree / Random Forest / KNN /  Logistic regression) on Titanic dataset.

# ðŸš¢ ML Model Comparison on Titanic Dataset

This project compares the performance of four different machine learning classification models on the Titanic dataset using accuracy as the evaluation metric.

## ðŸ§  Models Compared

- **Logistic Regression** (78%)
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (58%)
- **Decision Tree** (76%)
- **Random Forest** (77%)

Each model was trained and tested on the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes, and the accuracies were visualized for easy comparison.
